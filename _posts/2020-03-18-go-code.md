### [Write Go Code](https://golang.google.cn/doc/code.html)

## Your first program

first choose a module path (we'll use `example.com/user/hello`) and create a `go.mod` file that declares it:

```sh
$ mkdir goWork # Alternatively, clone it if it already exists in version control.
$ cd goWork
$ go mod init goWork  # example.com/user/hello
go: creating new go.mod: module goWork # example.com/user/hello
$ cat go.mod
```

```text
module goWork

go 1.14
```



The first statement in a Go source file must be `package name`. Executable commands must always use `package main`.

Next, create a file named `hello.go` inside that directory containing the following Go code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world.")
}
```

Now you can build and install that program with the `go` tool:

```sh
$ go install example.com/user/hello
```



You can use the `go env` command to ==portably== set the default value for an environment variable for future `go` commands:

```sh
$ go env -w GOBIN=/somewhere/else/bin
```

To ==unset== a variable previously set by `go env -w`, use `go env -u`:

```sh
$ go env -u GOBIN
```



Commands like `go install` apply within the context of the module containing the current working directory. If the working directory is not within the `example.com/user/hello` module, `go install` may fail.

For convenience, `go` commands accept paths relative to the working directory, and default to the package in the current working directory if no other path is given. So in our working directory, the following commands are all equivalent:

```
$ go install example.com/user/hello
$ go install .
$ go install
```



### Importing packages from your module

First, create a directory for the package named `$HOME/hello/morestrings`, and then a file named `reverse.go` in that directory

```go
package morestrings

// ReverseRunes returns its argument string reversed rune-wise left to right.
func ReverseRunes(s string) string {
	r := []rune(s)
	for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < len(r)/2; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
		r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
	}
	return string(r)
}
```

Because our `ReverseRunes` function begins with an ==upper-case== letter, it is [exported](https://golang.google.cn/ref/spec#Exported_identifiers), and can be used in other packages that import our `morestrings` package.

```go
$ cd $HOME/hello/morestrings
$ go build
```

$HOME/hello/hello.go

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"example.com/user/hello/morestrings"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(morestrings.ReverseRunes("!oG ,olleH"))
}
```

Install the `hello` program:

```
$ go install example.com/user/hello
```

Running the new version of the program, you should see a new, reversed message:

```
$ hello
Hello, Go!
```



### Importing packages from remote modules

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"example.com/user/hello/morestrings"
	"github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(morestrings.ReverseRunes("!oG ,olleH"))
	fmt.Println(cmp.Diff("Hello World", "Hello Go"))
}
```

When you run commands like `go install`, `go build`, or `go run`, the `go` command will automatically download the remote module and record its version in your `go.mod` file:

```sh
$ go install example.com/user/hello
go: finding module for package github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp
go: downloading github.com/google/go-cmp v0.4.0
go: found github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp in github.com/google/go-cmp v0.4.0
$ hello
Hello, Go!
  string(
- 	"Hello World",
+ 	"Hello Go",
  )
$ cat go.mod
```

```text

module example.com/user/hello

go 1.14

require github.com/google/go-cmp v0.4.0
```



Module dependencies are automatically downloaded to the `pkg/mod` subdirectory of the directory indicated by the `GOPATH` environment variable. The downloaded contents for a given version of a module are shared among all other modules that `require` that version, so the `go` command marks those files and directories as read-only. To remove all downloaded modules, you can pass the `-modcache` flag to `go clean`:

```
$ go clean -modcache
```



## Testing

Go has a lightweight test framework composed of the `go test` command and the `testing` package.

You write a test by creating a file with a name ending in `_test.go` that contains functions named `TestXXX` with signature `func (t *testing.T)`. The test framework runs each such function; if the function calls a failure function such as `t.Error` or `t.Fail`, the test is considered to have failed.

Add a test to the `morestrings` package by creating the file `$HOME/hello/morestrings/reverse_test.go` containing the following Go code.

```go
package morestrings

import "testing"

func TestReverseRunes(t *testing.T) {
	cases := []struct {
		in, want string
	}{
		{"Hello, world", "dlrow ,olleH"},
		{"Hello, 世界", "界世 ,olleH"},
		{"", ""},
	}
	for _, c := range cases {
		got := ReverseRunes(c.in)
		if got != c.want {
			t.Errorf("ReverseRunes(%q) == %q, want %q", c.in, got, c.want)
		}
	}
}
```

Then run the test with `go test`:

```sh
$ go test
PASS
ok  	example.com/user/morestrings 0.165s
```

Run `go help test` and see the [testing package documentation](https://golang.google.cn/pkg/testing/) for more detail.







### **$GOPATH/go.mod exists but should not**

开启模块支持后，并不能与$GOPATH共存,所以把项目从$GOPATH中移出即可

E:\data\gotest>dir
2020/03/16  19:00    <DIR>          .
2020/03/16  19:00    <DIR>          ..
2020/03/16  18:54                24 go.mod
2020/03/16  19:00                72 m.go
