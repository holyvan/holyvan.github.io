## [Launch apps](https://www.listary.com/docs/getting-started)

You can **press Ctrl** twice anytime to activate Listary to search all your apps and files.

When your search query **doesn’t contain spaces**, Listary lists apps first. If you want to search for only files, simply **add a space** anywhere in your search query.

## The 2 modes of Listary

You may have noticed that Listary has 2 modes. When you activate it using find-as-you-type, it pops up *at the bottom right corner of Explorer*. This is the **file manager mode**. When you activate Listary using the `Ctrl X 2` hotkey, it pops up *in the middle of the screen*. This is the **launcher mode**.

- **File manager mode**: This mode focuses on file searching. Listary search bar is shown within the current file manager window (e.g. Explorer). Folders are opened in the current file manager window. Features like app launching, web searching are *disabled*.
- **Launcher mode**: All features are available in this mode. Listary search bar is shown in the middle of the screen. Folders are opened in new file manager windows.

## Basic hotkeys

- `Type directly in Explorer`: Activate Listary to search.
- `Press Ctrl twice`: Manually activate Listary when you need it anytime.
- `Esc`: Hide Listary search bar / Exit Actions.
- `Down arrow` or `Ctrl + N`: Select next item.
- `Up arrow` or `Ctrl + P`: Select previous item.
- `Right arrow` or `Ctrl + O`: Enter Actions menu for the selected search result.

Check [this page](http://www.listary.com/docs/hotkeys) for the full list of hotkeys.

#### Commands hotkeys

The following hotkeys work when:

1. Listary search bar or menu is visible. You can use these hotkeys in file dialogs directly because Listary search bar is visible by default.
2. Or the “Enable Listary hotkeys” setting is checked in Listary Options – App Settings *for the current application*. It’s checked by default for Windows Explorer, so you can use these hotkeys in Explorer directly without activating Listary first.

After **selecting a search result** in Listary, you can use the following hotkeys:

- `Ctrl + Enter`: Open parent folder of this search result.
- `Ctrl + Shift + C`: Copy the path of this search result to clipboard.
- `Ctrl + C`: Copy this search result to clipboard (in file format).
- `Alt + S`: Open *Send to* menu for this result.
- `Alt + O`: Open *Open with* menu for this result.

You can change them in Listary Options – Actions.



### [Advanced search syntax](https://www.listary.com/docs/advanced-search-syntax)

## Specify parent folder names

You can tell Listary to show only results whose **parent folder names** contain certain keywords.
When you get too many search results, you can use this syntax to narrow things down quickly.

This is a [Listary Pro](http://www.listary.com/pro) feature.

#### Usage

Append a trailing `\` to a keyword to indicate that it’s part of the parent folder path. It can appear **anywhere** in the search query.

#### Examples

##### Search for `notepad.exe` within `Windows` folder:

- `win\note`
- `win\ note`
- `note win\`

##### Search for `Photo.jpg` within `My Documents` folder:

- `photo doc\`
- `photo doc\my\`
- `my\doc\photo`

##### Search for `Photo.jpg` within drive `D:\`:

- `d:\photo`
- `photo d:\`

## Search filters

Search filters allow you to search for specific file extensions or folders within specific folders.

#### Usage

Type the search filter keyword followed by a colon `:`. It can appear **anywhere** in the search query.
You can add your own search filters in Listary Options – Search.

#### Default search filters

- `folder:` Folder
- `file:` File
- `doc:` Document
- `pic:` Picture
- `audio:` Audio
- `video:` Video

#### Example

Search for a **folder** with `game` as part of its name:
\* `folder: game`
\* `game folder:`
